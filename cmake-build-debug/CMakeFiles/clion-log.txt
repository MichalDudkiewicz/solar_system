-- Could NOT find WrapVulkanHeaders (missing: Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Warning at /opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/Qt6/QtFeature.cmake:1249 (message):
  This project was initially configured with the Qt feature "vulkan" set to
  "OFF".  While loading the "Qt6::Gui" package, the value of the feature has
  changed to "ON".  That might cause a project rebuild due to updated C++
  headers.

  In case of build issues, consider removing the CMakeCache.txt file and
  reconfiguring the project.
